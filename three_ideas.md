### Overview

Prescription drugs are responsible for more deaths by overdose than any other illicit or controlled substance. They are responsible for the worrying addiction epidemic that is sweeping the western world. A facet of which has been officially recognised by the US government as the “Opioid Epidemic”.

For many prescription medications are a necessary part of life. However when abused, used in the wrong way, or in the wrong hands these substances can have devastating and all too often fatal consequences.

While reflecting upon this problem I recalled watching my sixty year old dad divide up his extensive collection of heart meds for the coming week. Filtering each of them into their respective day labeled drawers in his medicine box; before putting the rest of his months supply back in the drawer. More than once I have heard him frustratedly try to recall whether or not he had remembered to take this pill or that pill.

All of this has brought me to the conclusion that our current method for administering these potentially catastrophic substances is inherently flawed. Every day pharmacists depart fatal quantities of these substances on patients around the world and with that, the responsibility of correctly regulating the consumption of these substances.

This product would allow users to better regulate the consumption of their prescription medication. Patient’s prescription information would be logged in the application along with dosage information and instructions. 
Each day the application will remind users to take their medication at the correct time through notifications, conversational UI and connected home devices such as amazon’s echo. Ensuring that users do not neglect to do so. Once taken the application will remember this eliminating accidental overconsumption of medicines. This application could be accompanied by a connected home device that sorts and dispenses medications as needed. This would prevent habitual consumption of addictive substances that exceed dosage instructions, and could also prevent these drugs falling into the wrong hands.



### Pros

+ I have an interest in IOT and connected devices and am curious to learn how to design and build them. 

+ I have experience designing products in the healthcare sphere.

+ I have an interest in conversational interfaces and would like to design a product that utilizes them. 

+ I have several close relatives that have rely on prescription medication which gives me a good focus group for research.



### Cons

+ I have no experience building native applications or connected products, however I am eager to learn how. 

+ I have no experience building skills and features for home devices such as amazon’s echo. 



### How might it be built?

This product would ideally be built as an iOs application using swift, it would be accompanied by an amazon echo skill and would also utilize a connected device which would require some hardware. I have little experience building products such as this however I am passionate about the subject and am eager to learn.


### Who’s it for?

This product’s primary user would be people who take  prescription medications on a daily basis such as prescription painkillers and other addictive substances. However it may also be used for regular medications such as heart medications etc.

This might also be used by people who take daily or seasonal health supplements such as multivitamins, fish oils etc.


### What’s the business model?

I think the mobile and home applications could be monetised by utilizing either a flat fee or a subscription model for the service. However I am leaning more towards a flat rate fee as this is more of a product than a service.
Connected devices such as a home devices / medicine cabinet which dispenses medication as needed would also be bought for a flat fee. However this might be a service that exclusive pharmacies could use. Stocking these devices with the user’s monthly prescription.
