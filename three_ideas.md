Medicine Cabinet

### Overview

Prescription drugs are responsible for more deaths by overdose than any other illicit or controlled substance. They are responsible for the worrying addiction epidemic that is sweeping the western world. A facet of which has been officially recognised by the US government as the “Opioid Epidemic”.

For many prescription medications are a necessary part of life. However when abused, used in the wrong way, or in the wrong hands these substances can have devastating and all too often fatal consequences.

While reflecting upon this problem I recalled watching my sixty year old dad divide up his extensive collection of heart meds for the coming week. Filtering each of them into their respective day labeled drawers in his medicine box; before putting the rest of his months supply back in the drawer. More than once I have heard him frustratedly try to recall whether or not he had remembered to take this pill or that pill.

All of this has brought me to the conclusion that our current method for administering these potentially catastrophic substances is inherently flawed. Every day pharmacists depart fatal quantities of these substances on patients around the world and with that, the responsibility of correctly regulating the consumption of these substances.

This product would allow users to better regulate the consumption of their prescription medication. Patient’s prescription information would be logged in the application along with dosage information and instructions. 
Each day the application will remind users to take their medication at the correct time through notifications, conversational UI and connected home devices such as amazon’s echo. Ensuring that users do not neglect to do so. Once taken the application will remember this eliminating accidental overconsumption of medicines. This application could be accompanied by a connected home device that sorts and dispenses medications as needed. This would prevent habitual consumption of addictive substances that exceed dosage instructions, and could also prevent these drugs falling into the wrong hands.



### Pros

+ I have an interest in IOT and connected devices and am curious to learn how to design and build them. 

+ I have experience designing products in the healthcare sphere.

+ I have an interest in conversational interfaces and would like to design a product that utilizes them. 

+ I have several close relatives that have rely on prescription medication which gives me a good focus group for research.



### Cons

+ I have no experience building native applications or connected products, however I am eager to learn how. 

+ I have no experience building skills and features for home devices such as amazon’s echo. 



### How might it be built?

This product would ideally be built as an iOs application using swift, it would be accompanied by an amazon echo skill and would also utilize a connected device which would require some hardware. I have little experience building products such as this however I am passionate about the subject and am eager to learn.


### Who’s it for?

This product’s primary user would be people who take  prescription medications on a daily basis such as prescription painkillers and other addictive substances. However it may also be used for regular medications such as heart medications etc.

This might also be used by people who take daily or seasonal health supplements such as multivitamins, fish oils etc.


### What’s the business model?

I think the mobile and home applications could be monetised by utilizing either a flat fee or a subscription model for the service. However I am leaning more towards a flat rate fee as this is more of a product than a service.
Connected devices such as a home devices / medicine cabinet which dispenses medication as needed would also be bought for a flat fee. However this might be a service that exclusive pharmacies could use. Stocking these devices with the user’s monthly prescription. 






Billshare
----------------------

### Overview

Who’s round is it? We all have a friend who never buys his or her round. This can be a source of confrontation amongst any group of friends no matter how close. The inherent problem being the discussion of money an awkward affair no matter how wealthy the party. This is a issue not confined to the pub, but a regular occurrence amongst housemates when sharing rent and utility bills and any situation in which a bill must be split amongst multiple people. 
This service would evenly divide the bill amongst everyone in the party and would allow each member to contribute their share onto one account from which the bill would be paid. This service would be primarily driven by a mobile application and would allow any member of the party to pay for a bill from the application or perhaps from a debit card. No more awkward ”who owes what”  conversations or messy money transfers between accounts. 

The service could also include insights into payment histories, bill projections and insights for more efficiently managing bills. 




### Pros

+ I have a lot of experience designing user interfaces which this product would be mostly based around. 

+ I have plenty of student friends who share utility and rent bills which gives me good scope for research.




### Cons

+ Again I have no experience building native applications or connected products, however I am eager to learn how. 

+ Software that manages financial transfers and contains financial information are often heavily regulated and require sufficient security measures for which I do not have the expertise. However with technologies such as stripe and paypal I may be able to navigate around this hurdle. 




### How might it be built?

This product would again ideally be a native mobile application which would be built using swift (iOS). I have no experience building native applications however I am eager to learn. Furthermore I believe an initial working MVP web app  could be built using HTML, CSS and javascript utilizing either stripe or paypal APIs to handle payments.
The payment of bills could be done through a debit card which each member of the paying party could posess, or by utilizing radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near field communication (NFC) to allow users to pay contactlessly via their mobile devices.  



### Who’s it for?

This product’s main target audience would be young adults, primarily students and young professionals, married couples and families. These are the people most likely to be have communal bills. However it is not just confined to domestic bills, this product could be used in any situation in which a payment must be split between multiple people, paying for rounds, splitting dinner bills, workplace sweepstakes.


### What’s the business model?

Initially I had the idea of creating a subscription model with several different levels of membership, however this service would require every member of the party to have access to the app, and not everyone might be happy to sign up to a monthly subscription. A better way might be to charge a small service fee or commission for each payment or transfer, similar to how other services such as uber and airbnb operate. 




Carpool
----------------------

### Overview

There is a monopoly on transport, we work to afford the luxury of being able to get to work. Drivers pay exorbitant fuel costs. Those without their own personal transport are at the whim of profiteering services such as uber and exorbitant taxi fares. The only other option is a reliance on an incompetent overpriced public transport service. Travel for leisure is a luxury afforded only by the few. Belfast is the most congested city in the UK and to boot has the highest carbon footprint for per head in the UK.
This service would provide a mutually beneficial system by which both drivers and passengers can afford travel. 

A driver will plot their origin, destination and route through along with date and time details of a journey and the number of spaces available. Passengers hoping to travel this route can elect to share the trip. The application will calculate the cost of this trip based from the average fuel cost and distance to be traveled. It will then divide the cost between all passengers and the driver and will suggest a price that the passenger should donate towards fuel cost, payment might also be facilitated through the app. 





### Pros

+ This is a service  that I would personally use and would look forward to seeing on the market and so I can say to some degree there would be a demand. 

+ This would allow me to build a web app using html, css and javascript, giving me the opportunity to hone my technical skills. 

+ Making travel more efficient and accessible would solve many problems we are facing including city congestion and air pollution. 




### Cons

+ This would be a small service in an already massive travel and transport market so may be difficult to gain traction. However I am confident i can identify a niche and execute this in a way that makes it desirable

+ The build of this product would require a significant amount of technical knowledge and would require me to strengthen my technical skills and learn some new ones.





### How might it be built?

I think initially this product would best be served as a web app and can be built using HTML, CSS and javascript. It would be built upon google maps platform and might require an API to do so. I have not done this before but am eager to learn and confident it can be done. Payment would be facilitated by integrating stripe into the product.



### Who’s it for?

This product would be primarily for long distance travelers, such as commuters. It may also be utilised by people such as students who do not have their own mode of transport or financial means to travel. Tourists might also avail of this app. 


### What’s the business model?

The service could  be monetised by charging a commission or service fee, a small percentage of the donation from the passenger. The service could be free for basic features however it may be an option to offer advanced features such as social features.
